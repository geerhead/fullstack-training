[//]: # (3. On the left sidebar, select SSH Keys.)

[//]: # (4. In the Key box, paste the contents of your public key. If you manually copied the key, make sure you copy the entire key, which starts with ssh-rsa, ssh-dss, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, ssh-ed25519, sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com, or sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com, and may end with a comment.)

### If you do not have an SSH Key you'll need to create one using the following steps.

1. Open a terminal
2. Run the following command to generate the SSH Key:<br>```ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<comment>"```
3. The following output will be displayed, press `Enter`:<br>
```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```
4. Specify a passphrase for your key:<br>
```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```
5. Once you have done this you can follow the steps above to add the SSH Key to GitLab
