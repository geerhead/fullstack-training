## Add your SSH Key to GitLab
1. In GitLab on the top bar, in the top right corner, select your avatar.
2. Select Preferences.
3. On the left sidebar, select SSH Keys.
4. In the Key box, paste the contents of your public key. If you manually copied the key, make sure you copy the entire key, which starts with ssh-rsa, ssh-dss, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, ssh-ed25519, sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com, or sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com, and may end with a comment.
5. In the Title box, type a description, like Work Laptop or Home Workstation.

### If you do not have an SSH Key you'll need to create one using the following steps.

1. Open a terminal
2. Run the following command to generate the SSH Key:<br>```ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<comment>"```
3. The following output will be displayed, press `Enter`:<br>
```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```
4. Specify a passphrase for your key:<br>
```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```
5. Once you have done this you can follow the steps above to add the SSH Key to GitLab
